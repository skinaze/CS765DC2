				<p>Please select discussion file downloaded from canvas (csv File): </p>
				<input type="file" id="csvFile" name="Canvas csv" accept="text/csv" onchange="csvParse();" />
				<p id='defaultNotice'>The default file has been loaded! </p>
				<h2><a name="part1">Overall Assessment</a></h2>
				<div id="BoxChart"></div>
				<p>This plot shows four measurements of all the discussions in the uploaded file:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>A box plot showing the distribution of the root posts' total characters;</li>
				<li>A box plot showing the distribution of the reply posts' text characters;</li>
				<li>A dot plot showing the average of image per root post;</li>
				<li>A dot plot showing the average of response to a root post per root post;</li>
				<li>A dot plot showing the average of response that one person posts in this discussion;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the plot above: 1) The dashed line inside box plot is the average value, and the full line inside the box plot is the median value. 2) Outliers have a distance of more than 1.5x the interquartile range to the nearest interquartile. </p>
				<p>The primary purpose of this plot is to show the quality of one discussion compared with other discussions. There is an assumption that a discussion with high quality tends to have a longer post (more total characters), more images, and more responses. </p>
				<p>With the accurate statistic shown, the user can also check whether these discussions go as expected. For example, if there&#39;s a requirement for one discussion that the participants should include at least one image in their posts, but the average image number is way less than one. This indicates that most of the participants didn&#39;t finish the requirement and this can be an issue with the discussion description.</p>


				<h2><a name="part2">Participant behavior change in one discussion</a></h2>
				<p>Please choose a discussion: </p>
				<select id="disSelect" onchange="createViolinChart(dataByTopic, sigma, false);"></select>
				<div id="ViolinChart"></div>
				<p>This plot shows four measurements of one selected discussion in the uploaded file. Rather than showing participants&#39; behaviors in this discussion, it shows the change of behavior:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>The distribution of the change of the participants&#39; root post total characters against his/her average root post total characters;</li>
				<li>The distribution of the change of the participants&#39; reply post total characters against his/her average reply post total characters;</li>
				<li>The distribution of the change of the participants&#39; root post image numbers against his/her average root post image numbers;</li>
				<li>The distribution of the change of the response numbers that the participants&#39; root post received against the average response numbers that the participants&#39; root post received;</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the plot above: 1) The bright dot inside box plot is the median value. 2) Outliers have a distance of more than 1.5x the interquartile range to the nearest interquartile. 3) Red, blue and green color indicates the data points here are way behind (less than minus one standard diviation), normal (within one standard diviation range) and way ahead (over one standard diviation). </p>
				<p>The purpose of this plot is to show the quality of one discussion based on the assumption that a more exciting topic will inspire the participants to share more ideas (more total characters), post more images and get more responses than they usually do. Thus, a discussion with more area to the right should have a much better quality.</p>
